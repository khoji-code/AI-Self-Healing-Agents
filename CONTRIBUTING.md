I love your input!
I want to make contributing as easy and transparent as possible.

## Development Process
1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Code Style
- Use f-strings over `.format()`
- Add type hints for function parameters
- Keep functions focused on single responsibility
- Add docstrings to classes and methods

## Testing
Please add tests for new features:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/
